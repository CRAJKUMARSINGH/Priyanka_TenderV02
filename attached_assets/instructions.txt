You are an AI assistant tasked with assisting in the development of an app that processes tender-related documents. The app allows users to upload an Excel file containing Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) details, extracts key data, enables users to input bidder information for each bid, and generates the following documents: bid comparison sheet, scrutiny sheet, acceptance letter, and work order. The app also remembers one-line credentials (e.g., bidder name, contact) of the most recent bidders for future use.
Based on the provided image (assumed to contain a sample Excel file structure for NIT details and sample outputs for bid comparison, scrutiny sheet, acceptance letter, and work order), perform the following tasks:
1.  Describe the Process: Outline the step-by-step workflow of the app, including:
	•  Uploading and extracting data from the Excel file (e.g., tender ID, item details, quantities, estimated costs).
	•  Inputting bidder information (e.g., bidder name, bid amount, contact details).
	•  Generating bid comparison sheet, scrutiny sheet, acceptance letter, and work order.
	•  Storing and retrieving one-line credentials of recent bidders.
2.  Extract Data Structure: Based on the Excel file structure in the image, identify and list the key fields (e.g., columns like Tender ID, Item Description, Quantity, Estimated Cost) that the app should extract.
3.  Generate Sample Outputs: Using the sample outputs in the image, provide templates for:
	•  Bid Comparison Sheet: A table comparing bidders’ details (e.g., bidder name, bid amount, rank).
	•  Scrutiny Sheet: A document listing eligibility checks for each bidder (e.g., compliance with tender conditions).
	•  Acceptance Letter: A formal letter addressed to the winning bidder.
	•  Work Order: A document detailing the work assigned to the winning bidder.
4.  Handle Bidder Credentials: Propose a mechanism to store and retrieve one-line bidder credentials (e.g., bidder name, contact) for future tenders, ensuring quick access without re-entering data.
5.  Error Handling and Validation: Suggest validations for user inputs (e.g., ensuring bid amounts are numeric, checking for missing fields) and error messages for common issues (e.g., invalid Excel format).
6.  Optimize for Usability: Recommend features to make the app user-friendly, such as pre-filled fields for recent bidders, clear navigation, or export options for generated documents.
Ensure the response is concise, structured, and aligned with the app’s functionality as described. If specific details from the image are needed to tailor the response (e.g., exact column names or output formats), assume standard tender-related fields and formats based on common practices, and note where clarification from the image would help. Provide the response in a clear, professional format, suitable for guiding app development.
